# 🔧 Azure Deployment Issue Resolution

## ❌ **What Was Wrong:**

The GitHub Actions build was failing due to:

1. **YAML Syntax Error** - The workflow file had corrupted formatting
2. **Missing Azure Secrets** - The workflow needs Azure publish profile to deploy

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Repaired GitHub Actions Workflow** - Fixed YAML syntax errors
2. **Added Build Error Handling** - Build continues even if no build script exists
3. **Improved Error Messages** - Better logging for debugging

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Complete Azure Deployment:**

### **1. Set Up Azure Publish Profile Secret**

#### **Get Publish Profile:**
1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your Web App (e.g., `hyper-io-game`)
3. Click **"Get publish profile"** button
4. Download the `.publishsettings` file
5. Open it in notepad and copy ALL the XML content

#### **Add GitHub Secret:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Real-Yash/hyper.io`
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **"New repository secret"**
4. Name: `AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE`
5. Value: Paste the entire XML content from the publish profile
6. Click **"Add secret"**

### **2. Update App Name (if needed)**
In `.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`, line 53:
```yaml
app-name: 'hyper-io-game'  # ← Replace with your actual Azure app name
```

### **3. Test the Deployment**
After adding the secret, push any change to trigger deployment:
```bash
git checkout azure-deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Test Azure deployment"
git push origin azure-deployment
```

## 📊 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Fixed and working
- ❌ **Azure Publish Profile** - Needs to be added as GitHub secret
- ✅ **Azure Entry Point** - `server.js` ready for Azure
- ✅ **Package Configuration** - Optimized for Azure

## 🔍 **How to Check Status:**

1. **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/Real-Yash/hyper.io/actions
2. **Azure Portal**: Check your Web App deployment logs
3. **Build Logs**: Check the Actions tab for detailed error messages

Once you add the Azure publish profile secret, the deployment should work automatically! 🎉
