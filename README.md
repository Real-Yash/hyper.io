## Game Mechanics

### Mass System
- Players start with 20 mass
- Eating food pellets increases mass by 1
- Eating other players absorbs their mass
- Mass gradually decreases over time (0.002 per frame)
- Larger players move slower
- Players need >20% mass advantage to consume others

### Friendship System
- Send friend requests by right-clicking on players
- Friends cannot eat each other (mass protection)
- Friends can share mass through ejection
- Friendships are session-based (no persistence)
- Visual indicators show friend status

### Splitting & Ejection
- Split cells move faster but are more vulnerable
- Split cooldown: 2 seconds
- Mass ejection can be used for:
  - Feeding friends
  - Temporary speed boost
  - Strategic play

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Server-side logic goes in `server/src/game/`
2. Client-side logic goes in `client/src/js/`
3. UI components go in `client/src/js/ui/`
4. Update the game loop in both server and client as needed

### Debugging
- Server logs appear in the terminal
- Client logs appear in browser console
- Use browser DevTools for debugging client-side issues
